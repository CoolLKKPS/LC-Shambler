## Features

### Sneak Attacks:
The shambler will isolate itself when seen, preferring to sneak up on the player and stab them 
when they aren't looking!

However, looking at a shambler for too long, or too close will cause it to become aggressive.


### Leaping:
Just like a frog (albiet more terrifying), a Shambler will leap at nearby players when aggressive

### The Staking Process:
Shamblers are obsessed with impalement. They impale players with stakes and plant them at their nest.
Stakes prepare their prey for consumption later.

You can escape from a stake, though it might get bloody. Other players can even free you easily!
But DONT GET CAUGHT TRYIING TO ESCAPE! You WILL be punished...
